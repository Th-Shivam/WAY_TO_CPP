# 🚀 C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ Learning Repository! 👨‍💻

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository contains my C++ programs as I embark on my journey to learn C++. I'll be uploading programs, projects, and concepts I practice along the way.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Basic Syntax & I/O
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays & Strings
- Pointers & Memory Management
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (coming soon!)

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Started Learning C++
As a Computer Science student, C++ helps me build a strong foundation in programming, especially in problem-solving and understanding core concepts like memory management and OOP.


## ⚙️ How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/th-shivam/way_to_cpp.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:  
    ```bash
    cd way_to_cpp
    ```
3. Compile and run a program:  
    ```bash
    g++ check_leap -o Leap_year_check
    ./hello
    ```
